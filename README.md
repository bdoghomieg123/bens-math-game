#bens-math-game

Welcome to Ben's math program!

Currently, all the basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and division are included).

The division section sometimes is slightly broken. Fill out issue report if you run into bugs

Algebra concepts expected to come in v5.0.

If you notice any bugs/issues, fill out an issue report.


To use program:

Windows:
- Install Python3. (Note: make sure you add Python to path during installation. You will run into problems running program otherwise!)
- Save to your Desktop (Or wherever you want)
- CD to Desktop in command prompt (or directory you copied it to)
- Type "Python bens-math.py"
- Enjoy!
- (Note: Eventually, I will create a executable file that combines everything for a one file run for Windows)


Linux:
- Make sure that you have Python3 installed. Program will not work as intended in Python2 due to formatting and package discrepancies
- Right click in directory that you copied files over to. (Note: as of now, you need all the files for it to work.)
- Click "Open in terminal"
- Once Terminal opens, Type "Python3 bens-math.py"
- Enjoy!!
