Welcome to Ben's Math Program v2.8!

Currently, all the basic operations (Addition, Subtraction Multiplication, and division are included).

The division section sometimes is slightly broken. That is to be fixed in next update.

Algebra concepts expected to come in v5.0.

If you notice any bugs/issues, fill out an issue report.



To use program:

Windows:
- Install Python3. (Note: make sure you add Python to path during Installation or else you'll have problems running program)
- Save to your Desktop (Or wherever you want)
- CD to Desktop in command prompt (or directory you copied it to)
- Type "Python bens-math.py"
- Enjoy!

Linux:
- Make sure that you have Python3 installed. Program will not work as intended in Python2 due to formatting and package discrepancies

- Click "Open in terminal"
- Once Terminal opens, Type "Python3 bens-math.py"
- Enjoy!!
